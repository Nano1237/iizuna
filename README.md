The following examples can be found there:

### [scroll-buttons.html](https://github.com/Nano1237/iizuna/blob/examples/examples/scoll-buttons.html) 
The scroll buttons are the simplest components I have come up with. 
They are written with very little code and look very elegant.

There are two different types of scroll buttons:

1. [Simple scroll top buttons that just let you scroll to the top of the page](https://github.com/Nano1237/iizuna/blob/examples/src/components/scroll/scroll-top.component.ts)
2. [Buttons that scroll to a specific element](https://github.com/Nano1237/iizuna/blob/examples/src/components/scroll/scroll-to-target.component.ts)

### [modal.html](https://github.com/Nano1237/iizuna/blob/examples/examples/modal.html)

Modals that consist of two different components. 

1. [The buttons, which open/close the modals](https://github.com/Nano1237/iizuna/blob/examples/src/components/modal/modal-trigger.component.ts) 
2. [and the modal itself.](https://github.com/Nano1237/iizuna/blob/examples/src/components/modal/modal.component.ts)


### [accordion.html](https://github.com/Nano1237/iizuna/blob/examples/examples/accordion.html)
